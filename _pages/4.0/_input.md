# Input

Ruby2D provides a way of capturing and reacting to users input, provided via mouse, keyboard or game controller. Let's look into how this is achieved.

## Mouse events

Mouse events are captured whenever users mouse performs an action. Lets look into different types of mouse events:

### mouse_down, mouse_up

`mouse_down` and `mouse_up` events happen when a mouse key is pressed down, and released respectively. This is a simple program that leverages those events:

```
require "ruby2d"

on :mouse_down do |e|
  puts "Mouse down key event catched!"
end

on :mouse_up do |e|
  puts "Mouse up key event catched!"
end

show
```

Very simple! That `e` param passed into the event block, is a `MouseEvent` object. It contains detailed information about the event. For `mouse_down` and `mouse_up` events it will contain the following information:

#### type

`e.type` will equal to `:down` for a down event, and `:up` for an up event.

#### button

`e.button` will contain information about which button was pressed. It will equal to `:left`, `:right` or `:middle`.

#### x, y

`e.x` and `e.y` together describe the position on which the window was clicked.

### mouse_move

`mouse_move` event is fired when the mouse moves. Simple usage of this event would look like this:

```
require "ruby2d"

on :mouse_move do |e|
  puts "Mouse move event catched!"
end

show
```

This event is very useful for implementing behavior that requires reacting to users mouse position, such as hover feature on buttons. In case of this event, `MouseEvent` object contains the following information

#### type

`e.type` for this event will always be equal to `:move`.

#### x, y

`e.x` and `e.y` will describe the position of mouse pointer at the end, of the move event.

#### delta_x, delta_y

`e.delta_x` and `e.delta_y` describe the difference between mouse pointers position at the beginning of the move event, and at the end. Roughly speaking, this is how much the mouse actually moved.

### mouse_scroll

Mouse scroll event happens when user scrolls with the middle button. Simple usage of this event would look like this:

```
require "ruby2d"

on :mouse_scroll do |e|
  puts "Mouse scroll event catched!"
end

show
```

`MouseEvent` object of this event will contain the following information:

#### type

`e.type` for this event will always be equal to `:scroll`

#### direction

`e.direction` for this event will always be equal to `:normal`

#### delta_x, delta_y

`e.delta_x` will always be equal to `0`, and `e.delta_y` will be equal to either `-1` or `1`, based on the direction of scroll


## Keyboard events

Keyboard events are somewhat simpler than mouse events. There are 3 event types: `:key_down`, `:key_held` and `:key_up`. Those events are fired when the key is first pressed, on each frame for as long as long the key is held, and when the key is released, respectively. A simple program to take advantage of this feature would look like this:

```
require "ruby2d"

on :key_down do |e|
  puts "#{e.key} was pressed down!"
end

on :key_held do |e|
  puts "#{e.key} is held down!"
end

on :key_up do |e|
  puts "#{e.key} was released!"
end

show
```

`e` in this case is a `KeyEvent` object, and it's quite simpler than `MouseEvent`. It contains only 2 fields:

#### type

`e.type` will be equal to `:down`, `:held` or `:up`, based on the event type that happened.

#### key

`e.key` is a string containing the name of keyboard key that was pressed.



## Setting up multiple event handlers

Examples shown above present a good foundation, but as the codebase grows, you might want to be able to specify event handlers multiple times, in multiple places. This is as simple, as calling the `on` method as many times, as you want! Consider this example:

```
require "ruby2d"

on :mouse_down do
  puts "First event fired!"
end

on :mouse_down do
  puts "Second event fired!"
end

on :mouse_down do
  puts "Third event fired!"
end

show
```

Notice that whenever you press a mouse button down, all three events are fired in the order in which they were defined. You can specify as many event handlers as you want.

## Removing events

When you no longer need an event, you are allowed to remove it. This will require some initial planning. When you define an event handler, the definition will return an `EventDescriptor` object. In order to remove an event, you must pass this event descriptor to `off` method. Consider this example:

```
require "ruby2d"

event_descriptor = on :mouse_down do
  puts "Mouse down event catched!"
end

off(event_descriptor)

show
```

At the moment the window is showing, no events are set up!

## Setting up event handlers from non-root contexts

You might want to define event handlers dynamically, from within methods, or classess. This is also possible, and everything you have to do is to call `Application.on` and `Application.off` to set event handlers up, and to remove them. Simple!

For last example here, we will do something more complex. Each left button click will create an interactive square. Each of those squares change color when it's hovered on, and disappear when right-clicked.

```
require "ruby2d"

$interactive_squares = []

class InteractiveSquare
  def initialize(x, y)
    @square = Square.new(x: x, y: y, color: "green")

    @hover_event = Application.on :mouse_move do |e|
      if @square.contains?(e.x, e.y)
        @square.color = "red"
      else
        @square.color = "green"
      end
    end

    @remove_event = Application.on :mouse_up do |e|
      if e.button == :right
        if @square.contains?(e.x, e.y)
          self.remove
        end
      end
    end
  end

  def remove
    @square.remove
    Application.off(@hover_event)
    Application.off(@remove_event)
  end
end

on :mouse_down do |e|
  if e.button == :left
    $interactive_squares << InteractiveSquare.new(e.x, e.y)
  end
end

show
```

The gotcha is the fact that you are not allowed to define new event while executing an event of the same kind.
